  <p>Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream. the first mouse quickly gave up and drowned. The second mouse, wouldn't quit. he struggled so hard that eventually he churned that cream into butter and crawled out. Gentlemen, as of this moment, I am that second mouse.</p>

  <p>I got a fever, and the only prescription is more cowbell. This is America, babe, you gotta think big to be big. I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you, with a minimum of fuss!</p>
