Use the following code to create a Ruby file and run it. The file can be run either by `ruby filename` or, if you choose, you can set the executable bit (`chmod +x filename`) and add a shebang.

    puts 3 > 4
    puts (3 * 2) > 10
    puts 2 == 3
    puts (1 > 0) && (2 <= 1)
    puts 2 != 2
    puts (14 <= 10) || (2 >= 3)
    puts 10 % 2 == 1
    puts (10 ** 2) == 1000
    puts 1000 / 300 > 4

Now change the code above so that when you run it, all the equations are true.

Please create a gist of the final code and paste the url of the gist in an issue comment.
